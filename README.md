**ðŸŽ¶Spotify CloneðŸŽ¶**

This Spotify clone is a fully functional music player built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It mimics core Spotify features, allowing users to browse, play, and manage songs from different albums in an organized, user-friendly interface. The appâ€™s primary functionalities are as follows:

1. **Dynamic Song Listing and Display**:
   - The app dynamically fetches all songs from specific folders, filtering for `.mp3` and `.m4a` files.
   - The song titles are displayed in a scrollable list format, each with a play icon, making it easy for users to browse and select songs.
   - Spaces in song names are replaced with standard formatting for a clean display.

2. **Album Display and Selection**:
   - Albums, each with unique cover art and metadata (such as title and description), are displayed on the main page.
   - Clicking on an album loads its list of songs into the playerâ€™s library and starts playing the first song.
   - This feature also includes a dedicated play button overlay on each album cover for a quick start.

3. **Music Controls and Playback**:
   - **Play/Pause Toggle**: Users can start or pause the current track with a single button.
   - **Next and Previous Track**: Users can skip to the next or previous songs in the list using navigation buttons.
   - **Seek Bar**: A clickable seek bar allows users to jump to different parts of the song, with a moving circle indicator to show progress.
   - **Song Timer**: Each song displays the elapsed time and total duration in minutes and seconds, updating dynamically during playback.

4. **Volume Control and Mute Feature**:
   - A volume slider lets users adjust the sound level smoothly, from mute to maximum.
   - The mute button quickly toggles sound on and off, changing the volume icon to indicate the current state.

5. **Responsive Mobile Menu**:
   - The left-side menu is hidden by default for a cleaner layout on mobile screens. A hamburger icon opens this menu, allowing easy navigation.
   - Users can close the menu using an 'X' icon for convenient access to the main page.

6. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - All UI elements, such as play/pause icons, seek bar, and volume control, are represented with SVG icons, maintaining consistency with Spotifyâ€™s aesthetic.
   - The app is optimized for both desktop and mobile views, with custom controls to ensure a smooth experience across devices.

This Spotify clone offers an organized, Spotify-like experience for exploring and enjoying music, all through a web-based interface!
